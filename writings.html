                I give a new model for the &#8734;-category of <em>n</em>-dimensional bordisms. Currently, I am rewriting this preprint to take advantage of the technologoy in my thesis. In an ongoing project together with <a href="https://www.math.purdue.edu/~adebray/"> Arun Debray </a> we are working on adapting the model in this preprint to construct an equivariant (&#8734;,<em>n</em>)-category of bordisms and calculating its classifying in order to make precise various heuristics in Freed and Hopkins' program on invertible field theories.

            <p>
                I study the shape theory of the &#8734;-topos of differentiable stacks in great detail. In the process I recover Cisinski's model structure on the ordinary category set valued sheaves on smooth manifolds, yielding a model for homotopy types. This category has excellent formal properties, making it an excellent replacement for the category of topological spaces in applications to geometric topology.

                My thesis still has a few rough edges that need to be smoothed out. A future version will contain a new construction of the model structure on topological spaces, as well as a new proof that the geometric realisation-total singular complex functor is a Quillen equivalence.

            <p>
                For any regular scheme over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 I construct a resolution by commutative pro-algebraic groups, following an idea outlined by Serre in a letter to Grothendieck.
