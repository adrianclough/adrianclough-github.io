            </h2>
            <p>
                I am a research mathematician transitioning into industry. My research makes heavy use of homotopy theory and category
theory; the former leads to a "regularisation" of many areas of mathematics, and the latter provides a powerful organisational principal, aiding in the discovering of hidden patterns. I am excited to apply my problem solving skills as well as
my aptness for recognising fundamental principles to real world problems.

                Previously, I was postdoctoral associate at the <a href = "https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/faculty-labs-and-projects/center-for-quantum-and-topological-systems.html">Center for Quantum and Topological Systems</a> at NYU Abu Dhabi, working under <a href = "https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/science/faculty/hisham-sati.html">Hisham Sati</a> and <a href = "https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Urs+Schreiber">Urs Schreiber</a>. <br>
            </p>
                I graduated in August 2021 with a PhD in mathematics under the supervision of <a href = "https://ajblumberg.github.io">Andrew Blumberg</a>.
